Program that allows handling cryptographic data from the TPM chip.

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},
using the @code{agtexi-cmd} template and the option descriptions for the @code{tpmtool} program.

@anchor{tpmtool usage}
@subheading tpmtool help/usage (@option{--help})
@cindex tpmtool help

This is the automatically generated usage text for tpmtool.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.

@anchor{tpmtool debug}
@subheading debug option (-d)

This is the ``enable debugging'' option.
This option takes a number argument.
Specifies the debug level.
@anchor{tpmtool generate-rsa}
@subheading generate-rsa option

This is the ``generate an rsa private-public key pair'' option.
Generates an RSA private-public key pair in the TPM chip. 
The key may be stored in file system and protected by a PIN, or stored (registered)
in the TPM chip flash.
@anchor{tpmtool user}
@subheading user option

This is the ``any registered key will be a user key'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must appear in combination with the following options:
register.
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
system.
@end itemize

The generated key will be stored in a user specific persistent storage.
@anchor{tpmtool system}
@subheading system option

This is the ``any registered key will be a system key'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must appear in combination with the following options:
register.
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
user.
@end itemize

The generated key will be stored in system persistent storage.
@anchor{tpmtool test-sign}
@subheading test-sign option

This is the ``tests the signature operation of the provided object'' option.
This option takes a string argument @file{url}.
It can be used to test the correct operation of the signature operation.
This operation will sign and verify the signed data.
@anchor{tpmtool sec-param}
@subheading sec-param option

This is the ``specify the security level [low, legacy, medium, high, ultra].'' option.
This option takes a string argument @file{Security parameter}.
This is alternative to the bits option. Note however that the
values allowed by the TPM chip are quantized and given values may be rounded up.
@anchor{tpmtool inder}
@subheading inder option

This is the ``use the der format for keys.'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
can be disabled with --no-inder.
@end itemize

The input files will be assumed to be in the portable
DER format of TPM. The default format is a custom format used by various
TPM tools
@anchor{tpmtool outder}
@subheading outder option

This is the ``use der format for output keys'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
can be disabled with --no-outder.
@end itemize

The output will be in the TPM portable DER format.
@anchor{tpmtool srk-well-known}
@subheading srk-well-known option

This is the ``srk has well known password (20 bytes of zeros)'' option.
This option has no @samp{doc} documentation.
@anchor{tpmtool exit status}
@subheading tpmtool exit status

One of the following exit values will be returned:
@table @samp
@item 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
Successful program execution.
@item 1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
@end table

@anchor{tpmtool Examples}
@subheading tpmtool Examples
To generate a key that is to be stored in file system use:
@example
$ tpmtool --generate-rsa --bits 2048 --outfile tpmkey.pem
@end example

To generate a key that is to be stored in TPM's flash use:
@example
$ tpmtool --generate-rsa --bits 2048 --register --user
@end example

To get the public key of a TPM key use:
@example
$ tpmtool --pubkey tpmkey:uuid=58ad734b-bde6-45c7-89d8-756a55ad1891;storage=user \
          --outfile pubkey.pem
@end example

or if the key is stored in the file system:
@example
$ tpmtool --pubkey tpmkey:file=tmpkey.pem --outfile pubkey.pem
@end example

To list all keys stored in TPM use:
@example
$ tpmtool --list
@end example
